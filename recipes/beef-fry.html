        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Clean and cut beef into cube shaped pieces (preferably soup cut).</li>
            <li>Cook the beef in a pressure cooker with salt, pepper powder, meat masala, and a little water just enough to cover the meat. Pressure cook for 2 whistles and then remove the cooker from the flame. <br>Allow it to rest until the pressure goes off. Keep aside.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan and splutter mustard seeds. Add curry leaves, sliced shallots, green chilies, and a little salt. Saute until the onions turn translucent.</li>
            <li>Add ginger garlic paste, saute for a minute until the smell resides.</li>
            <li>Add spice powders; chili, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and mix well. Make sure to turn the heat to a low while adding the spice powders, so that it does not burn.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid from the pressure cooker and transfer the cooked beef with the remaining water to the pan, mix well with the masala and cook on a medium flame until the gravy dries out. Stir the gravy occasionally while cooking,<br> to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Add salt as needed.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a little oil in another pan and fry the coconut bites. As it starts to brown, add curry leaves and fry it along with the coconut bites until browned. Keep aside.</li>
            <li>When the gravy dries out, reduce the flame to a low and saute the beef in the pan for 10-15 minutes. Add the fried curry leaves and coconut bites, and mix well together. Scrape the sides of the pan, <br>toss until the meat is brown -black and dried out completely.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with Rice, Porotta, Appam, Naan, or any other bread.</li>
        </ol>
